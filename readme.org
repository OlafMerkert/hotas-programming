* Parsing Keyboard command settings for DCS

Currently, the code is working with keycommand files from DCS World 1.2.0, however due to some differences between the various aircraft,
one has to strip (or comment) some lines at the beginning and end of the file.
~load-config~ expects only a ~keyCommands = { ... }~ assignments at
the top level.  Also, there may be problems with (russian?) unicode characters,
even if those are commented out.

* Generating LaTeX tables with keybindings

If you want to generate your own PDF tables, have a look in the
~command-table-tex.lisp~ file.  The ~samples~ function is used to
generate the default keybinding LaTeX files, by invoking
~load-lua-generate-tex~.
